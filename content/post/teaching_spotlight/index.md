I was this month's graduate instructor spotlight in the newsletter of [CATLR, the Northeastern University teaching center](https://learning.northeastern.edu/). I was interviewed about how I started teaching, my research, and guiding students to look at things in new ways. [You can read my whole interview here.](https://learning.northeastern.edu/graduate-spotlight-sam-maron/)
