My research focuses on urban imaginaries and democracy in urban globality. My dissertation explores urban democracy through the International Olympic Committee and the lens of the Olympic Games, using case studies of Los Angeles 1984, and the Boston and Los Angeles bids for 2024 / 2028. I study how small groups of people change their worlds, from the LA elites of 1984 to the anti-Olympic activists in Boston and LA today. This project brings together history, the contestation of institutional legacy discourse, and resistance, to uncover how people shape the future of their city. In other projects, I bring my background with the Tibetan freedom movement and union organizing to the study of solidarity activism in social movements.
