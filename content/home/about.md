### About

My research uses mega-events as a lens to explore the intersections of global cultural institutions and power in global cities. My dissertation research uses Olympic Games bids and planning in Boston and Los Angeles (past and future) as case studies of how event-legacy discourses are made and contested, how they shape the future of the city, and how spaces for resistance are produced. In other projects, I bring my background with the Tibetan freedom movement and union organizing to the study of solidarity activism in social movements.
