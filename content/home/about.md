# About

Sam's research uses mega-events as a lens to explore the intersections of global cultural institutions and power in global cities. His current work uses Olympic Games bids and planning in Boston and Los Angeles (past and future) as case studies of how event-legacy discourses shape the future of the city. He also brings his background with the Tibetan freedom movement and union organizing to the study of solidarity activism in social movements. Prior to entering the PhD program in 2014, Sam earned an MS in environmental studies from Antioch University New England.
